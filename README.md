# Desku-Gradle-Starter-App
Example starter [Desku](https://github.com/Osiris-Team/Desku) app, built with Gradle.

- `build.gradle` file that generates Windows/Linux/Mac installers and binaries
with the help of [JavaPackager](https://github.com/fvarrui/JavaPackager) and [JavaFXPorts](https://docs.gluonhq.com/javafxports/).
I am working on Android and iOS support.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow file that creates a release, generates and uploads
all supported, platform-specific installers/binaries. Head over to the 'Actions' tab,
select 'release' and press on 'Run Workflow' to execute it.
- Basic project structure with example assets and tests.
